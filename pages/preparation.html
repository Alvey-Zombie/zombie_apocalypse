			<h2>Preparation</h2>
			<h3>Food and Water</h3>
			<p>
				Water is the most important part in survival for humans and not just in a zombie apocalypse so you will need to get right on that first. Water can be found in several places around the world and laws will not prevent you from getting it when most of the world is overrun. You can find water in bodies of water like lakes and rivers but you will probably need to boil it first to kill any bacteria found in it. Water can also be found in buildings running through the pipes. Food is also really important but you can survive longer without food than water. Food is probably the second step but won't be as hard to store as water and buildings often have it on hand. Supermarkets might be a good idea but people will probably have cleaned them out by the time you get to them. Looting homes that are empty of people and gas stations would be where I would go. Food and water is good to have on hand in case of an emergency anyways so it's better to have it now then to have to get it later.
			</p>
		    <h3>Weapons</h3>
		    <p>
		        Weapons, of course, are for defending yourself from the undead and maybe other survivors. They will be very important in an apocalypse if the undead are hostile towards humans or animals. The best weapons would be weapons that have range to prevent yourself from being infected. If lightsabers will be invented by the time the apocalypse happens,use them, because they will easily cut through hordes of zombies and you won't get their bodily fluids on you because it will cauterize the apendages you cut off. Automatic machine guns and flamethrowers would work the best if there are no lightsabers. Attack helicopters would mow them down fast and they wouldn't be able to get to you so if you can get your hands on one you should use it. 


		    </p>
			<h3>Supplies</h3>
			<p>
				If you are going to survive for long you are going to need supplies of some kind. Whether it be building supplies or medical supplies, you have to at least obtain some. Good places to go would probably be stores like pharmacies or stores like home depot assuming they are not overrun or empty. You will also need to have a sucure place to store the supplies so nobody, or nothing, gets in or out without your approval. You will probably also need to make sure you have a large supply of whatever you need so you will not have to risk more people to go back and get more. Anything you need can pretty much be found because the world will most likely be in chaos and dead people don't need supplies.
			</p>
			<h3>Bunker</h3>
			<p>
				 If the world is chock full of mindless undead creatures, you most likely will not be travelling much so you will need a safe place to stay and wait it out. Building a safe house or bunker probably wouldn't be an option so finding an already fortified base would be a good choice. You will need building supplies like I mentioned earlier to fix up the place or reinforce it. You will also need weapons to hold the position. You probably would want it to be a large base to hold lots of people and to have more places to run to. It also should have good soft ground to plant seeds just in case the apocolypse will last a while. A bunker is a must have to keep people in and the undead out.
			</p>
			<h3>Medicine</h3>
			<p>
			Keeping people healthy and fighting infection is probably something you want to do when fighting a war with a zombie virus. Because when somebody falls victim to the zombie virus you don't just lose a member of your team but you also have another undead to deal with. Finding people who are trained in the medical field to keep people alive and well and starting research to fight the disease would be a key step later in the apocalypse after your fortifications are set up. This also involves finding and making medical tools and drugs to keep people alive so you will need a farm to get herbs and medicines like mentioned earlier.
			Being infected by zombies will not be the only infection you will have to worry about. People die from infections every day that are not zombie related so medicine will still be needed.
