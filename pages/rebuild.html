			<h3>Restore Water Supply</h3>
			<p>
				Water is an extremely essential part of survival, and the reserve you built up during preparation would quickly be diminished. That's why it's very important to send people out to look for streams, rivers, and freshwater lakes. If there's a decent supply somewhat near the place you're staying, it's generally a good idea to make use of whatever you have to build around that supply. Eventually, you could maybe even start moving your supplies to the water if you have enough area and resources for building.
			</p>
			<p>
				Building large troughs to hold all the water you can is a great way to ensure you and your friends/colony never have a drought. Digging a large hole and having the water automatically drain to fill it is a great survival tactic. If you happen to have any clean wire, you should try to build filters to easily get large pieces of dirt out of the water. Another important technique is to heat all the water to a boiling point, no matter what. Skipping this could lead to the zombie virus infecting your water supply and all the members of your colony.
			</p>

			<h3>Create Farmland</h3>
			<p>
				Once your colony has managed to find a water supply, and if the supply is substantial enough, you should definitely start tilling land for crops. This is where seeds kept during preparation would come in handy. Use any decent metal tools you have to knock off grass and soften the soil. You should probably soften as much land as you have building materials to surround. A good area to use would be somewhere close to your source of water so you could dig irrigation ditches leading the water to your farmland.
			</p>

			<h3>Hold Farm Animals</h3>
			<p>
				If your crops are doing well you generally don't need farm animals, as they eat more food than they provide, but they can have some solid benefits. The first benefit would be protein. Even if you have muscle-helping crops such as beans, you'll still need a little extra to keep your colonists strong and intact (protein not only helps build muscle, but is very important in healing wounds and fighting off infections). Another benefit would be milk. Calcium and other very important vitamins and minerals are found in milk, so if you have enough food to supply animals, you should definitely consider milking them.
			</p>

			<h3>Develop a Vaccine</h3>
			<p>
				If you managed to save any science equipment (such as a microscope), your colony's most scientific minds should look at samples of infected blood to see the exact reactions and processes it causes. It's very hard to develop a vaccine if you don't have any equipment or scientific minds.
			</p>

			<h3>Form a Democracy</h3>
			<p>
				Teamwork is a must for survival in extremely dire situations. Everyone in your colony should have a say on what happens and doesn't happen. If one person is in charge of everyone, people will start to revolt and the colony will collapse extremely quickly. This is why it's important to develop a society with a voting system that allows all the citizens to decide on matters.
			</p>

			<h3>Build Walls</h3>
			<p>
				Using any building materials you have, you should have people work on building large barricades and walls to keep the extremely dangerous zombies away from your supplies and citizens. There should be a lot of empty area in between the walls and the actual city, so that zombies can't smell your delicious human flesh and brains quite as easily.
			</p>

			<h3>Set up Traps</h3>
			<p>
				In the margin between your walls and your city, setting up various traps (such as a large ditch or various deep holes) is a great way to keep the zombies far from your citizens. It's a somewhat risky job to set up zombie traps outside of your city walls, and generally unnecessary.
			</p>

			<h3>Build a School</h3>
			<p>
				If you intend on surviving for generations, it's a good idea to set up a school and have everyone teach the youth the best survival tactics. This ensures the future generations will be able to live on to a time beyond the zombie apocalypse. When setting up a school, make sure the location is in a central area, and as far away from the walls as possible (so that it would take zombies a long time to reach the kids). The school should have a very safe bunker, or basement, underneath it to hide the children during invasions.
			</p>

			<h3>Maintain Peace</h3>
			<p>
				The most important part of having a colony of survivers during an extremely tough time is to maintain peace. Make sure almost everyone is happy, and try to resolve conflicts as quickly as possible. Maintain a democracy so that everyone feels like they are a part of the well-being of the colony. During a zombie apocalypse, protesting and revolting is the last thing you need. It's important to be a strong colony where everyone has the power to freely change aspects of the structure if they earn enough support.
