			<h3>Check Resources</h3>
			<p>
				If there happens to be a zombie apocalypse, you'll want to load up all your resouces at different locations just in case. You might also want to check up on your resources, and be sure to bring somebody with you, to make sure that your resources aren't running low. Be aware of zombies, because you'll never know when and where they'll be coming from. If your resouces have already been low on stock, than your gonna have to hunt for food and other supplies.
			</p>
			<h3>Control People's Passage</h3>
			<p>
				Make sure everyone's portion of food and supplies are equal, no one should have more or less than the other. Make sure to use your supplies spareingly. 
			</p>
			<h3>Check For Infection</h3>
			<p>
				Beware of any infection during a zombie apocalypse. If someone has an infection, take the patient to a doctor, give the patient some medicine if needed, keep an eye on the patient, and make sure the patient is clean at all times. If the medicine is not working and the patients infection is getting worse, go and pray to whatever deity you follow and pray for mercy.
			</p>
			<h3>Keep Tabs on Everything</h3>
			<p>
				Keep an eye out on your resources. Always make sure that your resources are full and that everyone has their fair share. Be prepared for any infections that may occur. 
			</p>
			<h3>Maintain Order</h3>
			<p>
				Who ever is managing the resources, must keep an eye out on all the resources. The manager is the leader who keeps the resources in check. He/She sends people to check up on the resources and report back to them.
